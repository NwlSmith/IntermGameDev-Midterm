NEXT STEPS:

- Stencils

- Have needle move perpendicular to object
	- need to find the point of collision -> triggers instead of colliders? didn't calculate collision
	- whenever rotate around, after certain amount, make new line?

- Tattoo tentacle, not flat plane - connected ^

- reduce buffer distance? vary with distance mouse moves?

- Shading options/different opacity? - stretch goal

DONE:

Week 1:

- Destroy blood particles after a time

- Variable Needle Widths - visualized

- Fix clipping issues

- zooming with mouse wheel

Week 2:

- Tattoo on round object, gun rotates around capsule, moves out perpendicular

- Lines perpendicular to object

- Fixed Blood not expelling from collider
